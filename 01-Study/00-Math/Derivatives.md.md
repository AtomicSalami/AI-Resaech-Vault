Before trying to understand what the derivative is, we need to understand what the `slope` is.
The `slope` describes the rate of change of some `y` value in respect to some `x` value. It is much easier to understand from the graph:

![[derivative-1]]

Where `Δx` stands for the change in `x`, and `Δy` - change in `y`.
From this, we can calculate the `slope` as:

$$
{slope} = \frac{Δy}{Δx}
$$

For the linear functions, the `slope` for any given 2 points would be exactly the same. You can prove it to yourself by simply asking yourself: `does the angle of the function changes between any 2 points on the function's graph?`. 
But... how do we calculate the `rate of change` for the non-linear functions?

As we can see, for the non-linear functions, if we are using the same `slope` approach to calculate the rate of change, we wont go too far. First of all, the `slope` would only tell us the `average` rate of change between 2 points (and it will be different for every random set of 2 points). Second of all, the rate of change is changing with the time. Therefore there is a need to somehow find another way to figure out the rate of change. 

This is where the derivatives comes to play.
